Following are the changes which i have made for the refactoring as much as i can. I have change variable names and do some naming convention for better readability which i doesn't mentioned in below points.

BookingController.php

For Index() Method :
1. Simplified the index method condition using the has method to check if the user_id parameter exists.

For Update() Method :
1. Replaced array_except with except to remove specific keys from the request data in the update method.

For getHistory() Method :
1. Removed the unnecessary return null; statement.

For distanceFeed() Method :
1. Make a Validation rule for all the request keys.
2. Replace all the if else conditions with turnerey operators for better readability.

For resendSMSNotifications() Method :
1. Moved the validation rules to the validate method for the resendSMSNotifications method.

Rest of the code looks fine in the controller section.


BookingRepository.php

For getUsersJobs() Method :
1. Fixed variable names.
2. Instead of using a foreach loop, I used the collect method to create a collection and then used the each method to add the usercheck key to each item in the $normalJobs array.

For getUsersJobsHistory() Method :
1. Changed $request->get('page') to $request->input('page', 1) to set the default value of $page to 1 if it is not provided in the request.
2. Instead of setting $jobs and $normalJobs separately to the same value in the translator block, I set them to $jobs_ids directly, as they represent the same data. As per my understanding
3. Added return []; after the if-else block to ensure that an empty array is returned if the conditions for customer or translator are not met.

For Store() Method :
1. Store Method is looks like a mess and hard to understand, i split the logic of the store method into smaller methods to improve code readability and maintainability.
    Extracted the validation logic for customer data into a separate method validateCustomerData().
    Extracted the common data processing logic for both immediate and regular bookings into the processBookingData method.
    Extracted the logic to determine the gender and certified values from the job_for array into separate methods for better code organization.

For jobToData() Method :

1. Instead of using the array() syntax, I have used the [] syntax for creating arrays, which is more concise and modern.
2. Extract the due_date and due_time directly from the 'due' property using the explode function, eliminating the need for extra variables.
3. The getJobForValues method contains the logic for populating the job for array based on the gender and certified values. By doing this, the jobToData method is kept tidy and encourages code reuse.
4. 

For jobEnd() Method :
1. I have use Carbon's diff method to calculate the difference between start and end dates to get the session time in a new variable.

For getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId() Method :
1. In this refactored Block, I use the Eloquent relationship languages to get the languages associated with the user
2. I also use the filter() method on the query builder to perform the check for translator town within the same query.

For changeStatus() Method :
1. This block of code is written very well. Extract a bigger function into smaller chunks. I also use similar approach to break down a huge method for better efficiency and readability.


NOTE:
I haven't go through all the code in BookingRepository as it is a huge code block. Some Methods are written pretty well and some looks horrible which i tried my best to refactor.
As for unit testing i haven't do that as i never do it in any of my projects, but i know prettey much about how to write unit tests and did not try it here due to shortage of time.
